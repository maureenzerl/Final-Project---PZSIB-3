But the 9 products on the next pages have been scientifically proven to increase the risk of cancer. One out of three people develop cancer! You can take action today to protect your health against cancer in the future. First you need to know which 9 foods you should avoid from now. Read the next pages to discover the foods you should really stay away from!\r\nFresh tomatoes are very good for your health and even help you prevent cancer. Pay attention! This is not the case with canned tomatoes! How is this possible? Most cans are provided with a thin layer on the inside, which is usually made of bisphenol A (BPA). Research shows that BPA affects the hormonal activities in your body and the way the genes function in your brain. Because tomatoes are so sour, this is extra dangerous! The acid releases the toxic chemical from the can and leaks into the tomatoes. BPA shows a connection with different types of cancer, heart disease and fertility problems. Our advice: put canned tomatoes aside right away and choose tomatoes in glass or fresh tomatoes instead.\r\nNatural fish, especially salmon, is known as one of the healthiest foods. But not all salmon products are actually healthy! In Europe, a large part of the salmon is farmed in farms. This fish receives unnatural food and is often contaminated with chemicals, antibiotics, pesticides and other carcinogenic substances found in materials such as asbestos. Farmed salmon is also fatter than fresh salmon, so it absorbs more toxins. Make sure you choose fresh instead of farmed salmon!\r\nIf you’re a meat lover, it might be hard to give up tasty sandwiches and a piece of meat. But be careful with eating processed meat products! This is a long list that includes sausage, bacon, hot dogs and most cold cuts for bread. Years of study are showing us that 1 out of 17 people died who ate 160 grams of processed meat. That’s 44 percent more cancer risk than people who ate 20 grams or less! Meat processing uses a huge amount of chemicals and salt to keep them looking fresh. A large number of preservatives are also used, including the same substances that you find in cigarette smoke! Do you want to reduce the risk of cancer?

The plan would set pollution standards in the production of steel and aluminum.\r\nCountries with emissions exceeding the standards would pay higher tariffs when exporting metals to countries with lower emissions, the sources briefed on the plans said. Countries with steel and aluminum plant emissions at or below the standards would pay lower tariffs, the sources said.\r\nThe proposal, which is now being shared with industry and EU officials, has grown out of US-EU discussions on “green” steel production over the past year after Washington agreed to eliminate tariffs on EU-produced steel and aluminum in exchange for a quota system.\r\nUS steelmakers claim to have the world lowest carbon emissions levels, in part because 70 percent of American steel is made from scrap iron in electric-arc furnaces rather than coal-fired blast furnaces. Steelmakers elsewhere, including in Europe, rely more heavily on coal, and the plan would be advantageous to US producers.\r\nThe US-EU talks on low-carbon steel have been aimed in large part at China, which relies on coal for most of its steel output as well as low-grade iron ore that contributes to high carbon emissions. \r\nIf implemented, the plan would provide new grounds for excluding Chinese steel from Western markets. Most US tariffs are currently based on anti-dumping laws to combat pricing below production costs, laws aimed at combating unfair government subsidies or laws aimed at safeguarding strategic industries.\r\n“There would be an advantage of being in the club, as it would provide a lower level of carbon tariffs, while countries outside the club would pay higher tariffs,” one of the sources said, adding that the proposal aimed to incentivize investments to reduce emissions. \r\n“This is all very conceptual and there a lot of work ahead on this.

Another noteworthy starter includes the baked crabcakes, made from Maryland jumbo crabs cooked with panko breadcrumbs, served on top of a fresh mango sauce with parmesan foam. \r\nThe steaks are made with utmost care while the beef is sourced from the United States, Japan and Australia, with both dry aged and fresh options. The steaks are exclusively cooked over a wood fire before being rested and cooked again in a Josper grill -- the first procedure creates a beautiful outside texture while the second infuses the meat with smokiness and flavors from its own fat.

Sancang in the heart of the “Rain City”, Hagu Coffee & Space is hyping up contemporary F&B trends while featuring live mini concerts with some of the most promising indie musicians of the day.\r\nRunning a cafe that doubles as a live music venue is no easy feat, and this is especially so when the cafe in question is located in the West Java city of Bogor, nicknamed “Rain City” for the unpredictability of its weather. The prolonged pandemic certainly hasnt helped, either.\r\nFarhan Adrinanto, the founder of Hagu Coffee & Space, had understood the challenges that might come his way from the get-go. That said, ever since Hagu Coffee & Space opened its doors this March, Farhan and his team have hosted several live mini concerts featuring indie musicians. Six months on, and Farhan still maintains a straightforward and simple mindset.\r\n“Bogorians love hanging out. And they need entertainment!” the 26-year-old Bogor native told The Jakarta Post on Aug. 20, using the local vernacular for the citys residents.\r\nFilling a void\r\nThe idea for Hagu Coffee & Space came when Farhan observed a “void” in the “music activation” scene in his hometown. However, according to his prior research, Bogor residents generally preferred more than a run-of-the-mill amphitheater.\r\n“Thats why, at least in the minds of Bogorians, the most suitable space would be a cafe or a bar. Thats why we settled on a food-and-beverage establishment,” he said.\r\nThat said, Farhan and his team were aware that cafes had been mushrooming of late in Bogor, each with a signature style. To remain competitive, they decided that Hagu Coffee & Space would prove a point: that a cafe can be just as entertaining and ingenious as the glitziest, most glamorous bars in Jakarta.\r\n“People can seek an experience beyond simply sipping a cup of coffee,” said 25-year-old Fajar Bagas Adhi, the cafes marketing manager.\r\n“First is our music activation. Second is how our coffee shop can be a space for the customers. Third is how it can also be a space for workshops.\r\n“Why would customers need to go all the way to Jakarta to enroll in a workshop? Do they think a coffee shop in Bogor cant host them?” he added\r\nAnother question soon popped up as Farhan and his team developed Hagu: Were these twentysomethings perhaps too young to run a cafe with such a grand concept? Bagas said that at a certain point, he was worried that they might have bit off too much to begin with.\r\n“We felt like, Are we rushing into this? Is our concept a bit ill-conceived“ he recalled.\r\nUltimately, they decided to keep chewing anyway.\r\n“We [also] felt like we shouldnt overthink things, only to end up being too afraid to do anything. The insane thing, though, was that [even] when our concept was still undeveloped, Farhan had already gone ahead and secured the land.\r\n“I remember him saying, I secured the land because one, I love the spot, and two, this is concrete proof from me that Im serious about this,” Bagas added.\r\nDesign-wise, Hagu Coffee & Space is a one-story coffee shop split into two adjacent but differently themed spaces: a modest, indoor area and the more capacious, open-aired space resembling a scaled-down courtyard.\r\n“It doesnt need to exude splendor or lavishness. It should feel homey, but also offer a somewhat modish feel. We all know that rain is unpredictable in Bogor,” said Farhan. “Still, I much prefer a spot that offers a more spacious outdoor area than an indoor area.”\r\nAs for the cafes ideal customers, Farhan said that initially, Hagu Coffee & Space had targeted only Bogor youth. “However, the more we went on, older people and young parents have come to love our menu [as well].”', 1, 1),

As the condition runs in the family, many of them believe that its inevitable.”\r\nBut actually, these men can alleviate their condition with regular treatment. \r\nDermatologists in the United States usually prescribe patients with a topical solution that contains Minoxidil, which stimulates hair growth, and tablets that contain Finasteride, which decreases the androgen hormone that causes men to lose hair.\r\n“In Indonesia, the Food and Monitoring Agency [BPOM] doesnt authorize the use of Finasteride oral as it has a side effect of lowering mens libido,” Farah continued. \r\nBut a number of medical studies in Europe have shown that topical Finasteride has the same efficacy in combatting male baldness as the oral medicine, without the unwanted side effects. Therefore, Farah and her colleague, dermatologist Lili Legiawati, have decided to test a combination of topical Finasteride and Minoxidil to treat male patients with AGA. \r\n“For the research, well engage approximately 30 consenting Indonesian male patients in Jakarta as subjects,” Farah said. \r\nThese men will be given a topical solution that contains 0.1 percent Finasteride and 5 percent Minoxidil that they have to apply daily on their balding scalps. \r\n“They will have to visit us once a month so that we can observe their progress,” Farah said. “If all goes well, we should see new hair growth after three months.” \r\nFarah and Lilis research topic is among the five that won the Hair and Skin Research Grant 2022, a philanthropic program by LOréal Indonesia in collaboration with the Indonesian Association of Dermatology and Venereology (Perdoski) and the University of Indonesia (UI). \r\nThe program first started in Indonesia in 2021.

Approximately 80 percent of Indonesian people between 15 and 18 years old have acne. And more than 12 percent of men and women above 25 years old still experience the condition. \r\n“Most acne is caused by Propionibacterium acnes, Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis bacteria,” Ambar Rialita, a dermatologist and lecturer at the University of Tanjungpura in Pontianak, said.  \r\nWith five of her colleagues, Ambar will research the potential of black garlic to cure this common acne. \r\nThe black garlic used in the research will be made of mono-bulb white garlic, which has been fermented at 70 degrees Celsius and 90 percent humidity for 21 days. \r\n“Garlic is readily available in this country,” Ambar explained. “By fermenting it, its antibacterial compound Allicin will decrease, but its S-Allyl Cysteine [SAC] content, which helps the body absorb Allicin better, will soar. Thus, it will become a much stronger antibacterial.” \r\nThe research will be done in-vitro in a laboratory.\r\n“Well grow acne bacteria in a petri dish, then introduce the black garlic extracts into the dish and observe how they will react,” Ambar said. \r\nData from the research will serve as the basis for other scientists or dermatologists to develop effective anti-acne medicine from black garlic. \r\n“With science, we can maximize Indonesias biodiversity potentials to solve common skin problems in the country,” Ambar concluded. \r\nThe connection between Vitamin D and AGA\r\nVitamin D is crucial for the health of our bones, teeth and muscles. New studies reveal that the vitamin can also help prevent hair loss. \r\n“Many international studies have already proven the connection between Vitamin D levels and the severity of Androgenetic Alopecia,” Raissa, resident dermatovenereologist at RS Cipto Mangunkusumo, said. “But there isnt any research [on this matter] yet in Indonesia.” \r\nRaissa will survey the connection with 45 male patients in Jakarta aged 19 to 59 years old, with AGA severity from stage II (the least severe) to stage VII (the most severe), based on the Norwood-Hamilton classification.  \r\nThese subjects will get a free consultation with the dermatologist and a free blood test to determine the Vitamin D levels in their body. \r\n“If its proven [that men with the most severe degree of AGA have the lowest levels of vitamin D], dermatologists can recommend vitamin D supplements, in addition to medicines,” she said. \r\n“With science, we can identify factors that aggravate AGA and help determine additional therapies to alleviate the condition,” Raissa stated.

However, Indonesian cuisine has one side dish that is a staple on almost all dining tables across the country—kerupuk. Generally made from tapioca flour, there are a plethora of varieties—but here are the top 20.\r\nKerupuk bawang\r\nKerupuk bawang has a savory and crunchy taste that comes from garlic, hence kerupuk bawang (garlic cracker). In addition to garlic, kerupuk bawang needs other ingredients such as flour, salt, pepper powder, sugar, baking soda and water. This cracker is available in almost all parts of Indonesia. However, the kerupuk bawang in Indragiri Hulu Riau is different because it uses coconut milk as an additional ingredient. Due to its uniqueness, kerupuk bawang has become a must-buy snack souvenir from the area.\r\nKerupuk udang\r\nThis cracker originates from Sidoarjo, East Java. The fishermen of Sidoarjo used to be perplexed by the abundance of fish and shrimp they caught, so they invented kerupuk udang (prawn cracker). The catches were used as the primary material for making the crackers. Tapioca flour and mashed shrimp are the essential ingredients in kerupuk udang. Aside from the strong shrimp flavor, kerupuk udang has a high nutritional content, including phosphorus, calcium and iron.\r\nKerupuk Melinjo\r\nThis cracker has a slightly bitter taste and does not use tapioca flour or fish as the primary ingredients. The people of Selayar, South Sulawesi, make this cracker from melinjo seeds. As one of the traditional dishes of the province, these crackers are made traditionally by grounding the melinjo seeds one by one to produce their natural flavor. Kerupuk melinjo, frequently known as emping, is available in a variety of flavors, including salty, spicy and sweet, depending on the amount of salt or caramelized sugar added.\r\nKerupuk blek\r\nKerupuk blek dates back to the 19th century when cassava production was abundant in Java. Only someone called a tukang ngabalo (concoctor) can make kerupuk blek dough. After the tukang ngabalo finishes the dough, it is placed in a container resembling a large pipe and pressed with a stone by someone known as juru batu (stoneman). After the dough-making process is completed, the dough will be moved to an ebeg, which is similar to a frame booth. \r\nThe ebeg is about a meter long and half a meter wide. The dough is dried before being fried in high-temperature coconut oil. The finished product is typically stored in a blek (zinc food container), which is how it earned its name. \r\nKerupuk rambak\r\nKerupuk rambak (skin cracker) is made by soaking cow hide in lime water for 48 hours. In addition to the soaking, the hairs on the skin are removed with a knife. The clean skin is sun-dried, cut into size-appropriate pieces and boiled with garlic, salt and sugar. Once cooked, the skin is drained and dried before being fried again. Tulungangung, East Java, is the home of kerupuk rambak. Nonetheless, it is frequently found along with Yogyakartas traditional dish krecek.\r\nKerupuk gendar\r\nKerupuk gendar is commonly found in Blora, Solo, Madiun and Salatiga on the island of Java. Indonesians often consume kerupuk gendar as a snack or a rice complement due to the crunchy and savory taste that comes from the cooked rice. Kerupuk gendar is not only made from cooked rice. Tapioca flour is also essential for the dough-making process since tapioca flour has a significant role in making the kerupuk crunchy. Through the frying process, kerupuk gendar comes in a variety of flavors, including onion and spicy. \r\nKerupuk kemplang\r\nKerupuk kemplang is made using the dikemplang (hitting) method so the dough is flattened. This cracker originates from Palembang, South Sumatra. Kerupuk kemplang was traditionally made from belida fish. However, as the population of this type of fish has declined, it is being replaced by gabus fish. Kerupuk kemplang is processed by baking it over coals until it expands. Due to its baking process, kerupuk kemplang has a distinct aroma compared with other crackers. \r\nRengginang\r\nOriginating on the island of Java, rengginang is a kind of thick circular cracker made from glutinous rice. Unlike other types of crackers that are made from a mashed mixture of ingredients such as tapioca flour or grounded melinjo seeds, rengginang is not ground, so the shape of the glutinous rice grains remains visible.', 4, 2),
